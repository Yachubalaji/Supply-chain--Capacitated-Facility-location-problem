🏭 README for 'Capacitated Facility Location Problem' Jupyter Notebook

📌 Introduction:
Welcome to the "Capacitated Facility Location Problem" Jupyter Notebook. This notebook serves as an in-depth exploration of one of the key problems in operations research and logistics. It's tailored for those interested in the strategic decision-making process involved in facility placement and capacity allocation.

🧠 Problem Overview:
The Capacitated Facility Location Problem (CFLP) involves finding the most cost-effective locations for facilities (like warehouses or factories) while considering capacity constraints. This problem is critical in logistics and supply chain management, as it directly impacts operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

💻 Notebook Structure:
While the notebook does not have explicit sections, it typically covers:

Theoretical Background: An introduction to the CFLP.
Problem Formulation: Mathematical modeling of the problem.
Solution Approach: Implementation of algorithms to solve the CFLP.
Results and Analysis: Visualizations and interpretations of the solutions.
🚀 Usage:
Ensure Python and necessary libraries (like numpy, pandas, matplotlib) are installed.
Run the notebook cell by cell to understand the problem-solving process.
Experiment with different data inputs and parameters to explore various scenarios.
